        <ol>
        <li>Cook the pancetta until lightly browned and crisp, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Boil spaghetti, reserve two cups of pasta water, and set aside. </li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs in a bowl, then whisk in 1 ½ cups of the hot pasta water.  </li>
        <li>Whisk in the cheese and cream.  </li>
        <li>Add the pasta, pancetta, and chicken to the sauce and toss. </li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a prepared baking dish and bake until the sauce is thickened. </li>
        <li>Stir and let stand so the sauce can continue to thicken. Add more pasta water if you like. </li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and Parmesan cheese. </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
